# hangman
A game of hangman.

This was built using vanilla CSS and JavaScript (and some HTML of course).
It is a traditional game of hangman where the goal is to guess a mystery value within a specific number of turns.
When a user wins the game, an API call is utilized by way of Axios to retrieve information about the winning term.
That information is then displayed for the user, as well as an option to start a new game.
